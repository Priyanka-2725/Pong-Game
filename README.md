## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic **Pong Game** using **Java** and **Swing GUI**. It simulates a simple 2-player ping-pong game where players control paddles to hit a bouncing ball across the screen.

This game was built as part of my learning journey in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **GUI development**, and **basic game loops** in Java.
